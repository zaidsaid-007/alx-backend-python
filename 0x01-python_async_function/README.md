## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

## What I Have Learned
By working on this project, I have learned:

1. **async and await syntax:**
   - I understand how to define asynchronous functions using the `async def` syntax.
   - I have learned to use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of an async function until the awaited task is complete.

2. **How to execute an async program with asyncio:**
   - I can now run asynchronous programs using `asyncio.run()`.
   - I have practiced managing the event loop provided by the `asyncio` module.

3. **How to run concurrent coroutines:**
   - I have learned to use `asyncio.gather()` to run multiple coroutines concurrently and wait for their completion.
   - I understand how to handle multiple asynchronous tasks in parallel.

4. **How to create asyncio tasks:**
   - I can create tasks using `asyncio.create_task()` to schedule coroutines to run concurrently.
   - I am able to manage and cancel tasks as needed.

5. **How to use the random module:**
   - I have learned to use `random.uniform()` to generate random floating-point numbers within a specified range.
   - I understand how to incorporate randomness into my asynchronous programs.
